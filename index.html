<h1 text align="center">History of Pizza</h1>
    <p style=font-size:25px;text-align:center>The origin of the word pizza is uncertain. It is Italian for ‘pie’ and may have come from Latin pix ‘pitch’ or Greek pitta. It is common belief that pizza was an invention by the Italians. However, the history of pizza goes back to the ancient times in the Middle East. The Greeks, Egyptians, Armenians, Israelis, and Babylonians were making some derivative of pizza in the ancient times. They would cook flat bread in mud ovens. Workingmen and their families ate it because it was a thrifty and convenient food. The Greeks, Romans, and Egyptians specifically, were topping the bread with olive oil and spices, now known as focaccia.

            <td>Pizza first made its appearance in the United States with the arrival of Italian immigrants in the late 19th century and was very popular among large Italian populations in New York City, Chicago, Philadelphia, and Saint Louis. In the late 19th century, pizza was introduced by peddlers who walked up and down the streets with a metal washtub of pizzas on their heads, selling their pizzas at two cents a slice. It was not long until small cafes and groceries began offering pizzas to their Italian American communities.</td>
            <td>Canada was first introduced to pizza in the late 1950s, with the first pizza ovens entering the country. It gained popularity throughout the 1960s, with many pizzerias and restaurants opening across the country. Pizza was mostly served in restaurants and small pizzerias. Most pizza restaurants across Canada also serve popular Italian cuisine in addition to pizza, such as pasta, salad, soups and sandwiches. Fast-food pizza chains also provide other side options for customers to choose from, in addition to ordering pizza, including chicken wings, fries and poutine, salad, and calzones. Pizza chains across Canada can be found in shopping centres, schools, and neighbourhood plazas, with the majority of these chains offering a sit-and-dine facility for customers.</td>
            <td>Back in the 1800s, pizza was just a quick food to cook for the poor in Naples as the tradition says it was just made with tomatoes and cheese on bread. And if we notice, the pizza represents the Italian flag through its colors: basil for green, cheese for white, and tomatoes for red. This basic style of pizza is known to us as the pizza margherita. Even the name has a history behind it. The story has it, that when Italy was unified, the king and queen of France came to visit Italy and stopped in Naples. They had gotten fed up with eating French cuisine, so they tried Neapolitan pizza. The queen of France, Queen Margherita, fell in love with the basic yet tasty pizza with just bread, sauce, cheese, and basil. The baker Raffaele felt appreciated and named the pizza after the queen, hence the name that we have till today, pizza margherita! <img src="pizza2.jpg" width=300px></td>
